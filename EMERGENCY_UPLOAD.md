# 🆘 EMERGENCY: Upload Your Code RIGHT NOW (Takes 2 Minutes)

## Use GitHub Website - Upload Files Directly

**This bypasses all the Git/Desktop issues. Just upload your files.**

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
1. **Open Finder** (the file manager on Mac)
2. **Go to:** `/Users/nataliiaivanova/Documents/Core-Design/Website 2.0`
3. **Select ALL files and folders** (Cmd+A)
4. **Make a ZIP file:**
   - Right-click → "Compress Items"
   - Or select all, right-click, choose "Compress 6 items"
   - You'll get a file called `Website 2.0.zip`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/Designativ/core-systems-website
2. **Click the big green button** that says **"uploading an existing file"** (it's a link on the page)
   - OR click **"Add file"** button → **"Upload files"**

3. **Drag and drop your ZIP file** OR click "choose your files" and select `Website 2.0.zip`

4. **Scroll down** and click **"Commit changes"** button
