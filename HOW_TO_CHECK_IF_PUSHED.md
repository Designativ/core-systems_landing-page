# ✅ How to Check if Your Code Was Pushed to GitHub

## Quick Check in GitHub Desktop:

### Method 1: Look at the Top Right Corner

1. **Look at the top right** of GitHub Desktop window
2. **Check the status:**
   - ✅ **"Up to date"** or **"Published"** = Everything is pushed!
   - ❌ **"Push origin"** or **"X commits to push"** = Still needs to be pushed

### Method 2: Check the Branch Menu

1. Click **"Branch"** menu at the top
2. If it shows:
   - ✅ **"Push Branch"** is grayed out = Already pushed!
   - ❌ **"Push Branch"** is clickable = Not pushed yet

### Method 3: View History Tab

1. Click the **"History"** tab (left side, next to "Changes")
2. **Look at your commits:**
   - If they're all there = Good!
   - You should see commits like:
     - "Remove GitHub tokens from files"
     - "Add deployment guides and push instructions"
     - etc.

### Method 4: Check GitHub Website (Most Reliable!)

1. **Click "Repository" menu** → **"View on GitHub"**
   - OR go to: https://github.com/Designativ/core-systems-website
   
2. **You should see:**
   - ✅ All your folders (`src/`, `public/`, etc.)
   - ✅ Your files listed
   - ✅ Commit history at the top
   - ✅ Latest commit: "Remove GitHub tokens from files"

**If you see all your files on the GitHub website = Success! ✅**

## What Your Status Shows:

The message **"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"** means:

- ✅ You're good to go!

## If You Have New Changes to Push:

If you make new changes later:

1. Make your changes in Cursor
2. In GitHub Desktop, you'll see them under "Changes" tab
3. Write a commit message
4. Click **"Commit to main"**
5. Click **"Push origin"** button (top right)
6. Wait for it to finish
7. Check - should say "Up to date" when done!
